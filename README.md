CAD (step) models for Pelican Protector and Storm cases

I do not own, nor did I create these models. They are directly from Pelican. This repository only makes the collection more portable.
YOU STILL MUST AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS at the following url:

Why I did this:
It is fantastic that a lot of manufacturers are providing CAD files these days. Pelican did it well in that they only require you to check an agreement box, then you can download as much as you want. Many other companies try to hide their CAD and datasheets behind a sign-up wall so they can market to you. Annoying.
However one small issue I always have, is that it would be nice if there was at least the option of downloading the ENTIRE collection, rather than case by case, file by file.
When building a lot of one-off projects that need cases, it is nice to just have it all in one place, ready to go.
So, if you need to try a few different cases in CAD before deciding which one fits best, you can.

I do not intend nore wish to violate any copyrights. I simply want to make the collection available as a whole, to myself (across the various machines I work on) and others.

Along the way, you may occasionally see additional files, made in FreeCAD, such as bezels or whatever, which I have designed but may be useful to you.
